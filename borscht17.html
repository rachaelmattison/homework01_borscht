<h3 class="h17"> Borscht. </h3>

<p class="ing17"> 
<br>300g beetroot, peeled
<br>50g butter
<br>1 small onion, <br>1 small carrot, <br>1 stick of celery, <br>1 small leek, <br>all peeled where necessary and cut into small dice or rings
<br>2 grains allspice
<br>½ bay leaf
<br>1.5l gelatinous beef stock
<br>2 medium floury potatoes, eg Maris Piper, peeled and cut into small dice
<br>½ small cabbage, shredded
<br>4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
<br>2 tbsp cider vinegar
<br>1 tsp sugar
<br>½ tsp ground black pepper
<br>Sour cream and fresh dill, to serve
</p>


<p class="steps17"> <br>Cut ¾ of the peeled beetroot into small dice (you may want to wear rubber gloves to do this) and set the rest aside. <br>Melt the butter in a large pan, and then soften the onion over a gentle heat for 5 minutes.

<br>Add the carrot, leek, celery, diced beetroot, allspice and bay leaf and stir well to coat with butter. <br>Cook for another 10 minutes, adding a little stock if the vegetables begin to look dry. Meanwhile, grate the remaining beetroot.

<br>Pour in the rest of the stock and the potatoes and simmer for 15 minutes, then add the cabbage, garlic and grated beetroot. <br>Cook until all the vegetables are tender (about 10 minutes).

<br>Add the vinegar, sugar, pepper and a pinch of salt and taste. <br>Add a little more of any of these if necessary, then serve with a dollop of sour cream, a sprig of dill, and some Polish bread on the side.
