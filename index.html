<h5> <em> How to Peel and Cut Beets </em>
	</h5>
	<p> <h5> Use gloves when handling beets or your fingertips will stain red for a couple of days. <br>
To peel beets, use a simple potato peeler like this one.<br>
You can slice the beets into matchsticks but it is way way easier to grate and children don’t mind the texture of grated beets. <br> We love our food processor for this task as it grates more coarsely than on a hand grater so the beets still have some texture. <br> It also keeps the counter and your hands clean (beat juice can be a pain to get out of clothing and porous surfaces). </h5> </p>

<h2> INGREDIENTS </h2>

<p> 3 medium beets peeled and grated <br>
4 Tbsp olive oil divided <br>
4 cups reduced sodium chicken broth + 6 cups water <br>
3 medium yukon potatoes peeled and sliced into bite-sized pieces <br>
2 carrots peeled and thinly sliced
</p>

<br>

<h2> PROCEDURE </h2>
<p> Peel, grate and/or slice all vegetables, keeping sliced potatoes in cold water until ready to use. <br>

Heat a large soup pot (5 1/2 Qt or larger) over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp olive oil. <br>

Add grated beets and sauté 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until beets are softened. <br>

Add 4 cups broth and 6 cups water. <br>

Add sliced potatoes and sliced carrots then cook for 10-15 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.<br>
While potatoes are cooking, place a large skillet over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. <br>

Add chopped onion, celery and bell pepper. Saute stirring occasionally until softened and lightly golden (7-8 minutes). <br>

Add 4 Tbsp Ketchup and stir fry 30 seconds then transfer to the soup pot to continue cooking with the potatoes. 
<br>

When potatoes and carrots reach desired softness, add 1 can of beans with their juice, 2 bay leaves, 2-3 Tbsp white vinegar, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 pressed garlic clove, and 3 Tbsp chopped dill. <br>

Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes and add more salt and vinegar to taste.<br>

<h5> <em> How to Remove Beet Stains </em></h5>

<h6> When you eat borscht often, you learn quickly to pace a napkin in your lap and bibs on children. If you do get beet juice on your clothes, address the stain right away.

Use a paper-towel to blot off any excess juice. <br>
Run cold water over the opposite/under side of the fabric to push the stain out. <br>
If the stain persists, apply a stain removing agent (I have found that dish soap works well in a pinch) and launder clothing as usual.</h6>
