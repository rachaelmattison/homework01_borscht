<h1> AN EVEN <em> BETTER </em> BORSCHT RECIPE</h1>
<ol><h3> How to Cut and Peel Beets: </h3></ol>
<li> Use gloves when handling beets or your fingertips will stain red for a couple of days.
<li>To peel beets, use a simple potato peeler like this one.
<li>You can slice the beets into matchsticks but it is way way easier to grate and children don’t mind the texture of grated beets. 
<br><ol><ol><em>We love our food processor for this task as it grates more coarsely than on a hand grater so the beets still have some texture. </em></ol></ol>
	<ol><ol><em>It also keeps the counter and your hands clean (beat juice can be a pain to get out of clothing and porous surfaces).</em></ol></ol>
</li>

<h2> INGREDIENTS: </h2>
	<h3><li>3 medium beets peeled and grated
<li>4 Tbsp olive oil divided
<li>4 cups reduced sodium chicken broth + 6 cups water
<li>3 medium yukon potatoes peeled and sliced into bite-sized pieces
<li>2 carrots peeled and thinly sliced
</h3>

<h2> INSTRUCTIONS: </h2>
<ol> <li> <h4> Peel, grate and/or slice all vegetables, keeping sliced potatoes in cold water until ready to use.

	<li>Heat a large soup pot (5 1/2 Qt or larger) over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp olive oil. 

<li>Add grated beets and sauté 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until beets are softened. 

<li>Add 4 cups broth and 6 cups water. 

<li>Add sliced potatoes and sliced carrots then cook for 10-15 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.
	<span>While potatoes are cooking, place a large skillet over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. </span>

<li>Add chopped onion, celery and bell pepper. 
	<li>Saute stirring occasionally until softened and lightly golden (7-8 minutes). 
<li>Add 4 Tbsp Ketchup and stir fry 30 seconds then transfer to the soup pot to continue cooking with the potatoes.

<li>When potatoes and carrots reach desired softness, add 1 can of beans with their juice, 2 bay leaves, 2-3 Tbsp white vinegar, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 pressed garlic clove, and 3 Tbsp chopped dill. 

<li>Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes and add more salt and vinegar to taste.</li> </ol>

<h4> <ol> HOW TO REMOVE BEET STAINS:</ol> </h4>
 <h5> 
 	<li> When you eat borscht often, you learn quickly to pace a napkin in your lap and bibs on children. 
	<li> If you do get beet juice on your clothes, address the stain right away.

<li> Use a paper-towel to blot off any excess juice.
Run cold water over the opposite/under side of the fabric to push the stain out.
<li> If the stain persists, apply a stain removing agent (I have found that dish soap works well in a pinch) and launder clothing as usual.</h5></li>
