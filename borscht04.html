<h2> AN <h1> <em> EVEN BETTER </em></h1> <h2> BORSCHT RECIPE!! </h2> </h2>

<ul> PREP TIME: 20 MINUTES </ul>
<ul> COOK TIME: 1 HOUR 40 MINUTES </ul>
<ul> TOTAL TIME: 2 HOURS </ul>

<ol> <ol> <ol> How To Peel And Cut Beets: </ol> </ol> </ol>
<li>Use gloves when handling beets or your fingertips will stain red for a couple of days.
<li> To peel beets, use a simple potato peeler like this one.
<li> You can slice the beets into matchsticks but it is way way easier to grate and children don’t mind the texture of grated beets. <br> <br> <em> We love our food processor for this task as it grates more coarsely than on a hand grater so the beets still have some texture. It also keeps the counter and your hands clean (beat juice can be a pain to get out of clothing and porous surfaces). </em> </li>


<ol> <h3> INGREDIENTS: </h3> </ol>

<ul> 
<li>3 medium beets peeled and grated
<li> 4 Tbsp olive oil divided
<li>4 cups reduced sodium chicken broth + 6 cups water
<li>3 medium yukon potatoes peeled and sliced into bite-sized pieces
<li>2 carrots peeled and thinly sliced
</ul>


<ol> <h3> INSTRUCTIONS: </h3></ol>
<ul> 
<li>Peel, grate and/or slice all vegetables, keeping sliced potatoes in cold water until ready to use.

<li>Heat a large soup pot (5 1/2 Qt or larger) over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp olive oil. 

<li>Add grated beets and sauté 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until beets are softened. 

<li>Add 4 cups broth and 6 cups water. 

<li>Add sliced potatoes and sliced carrots then cook for 10-15 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.<em>
While potatoes are cooking, place a large skillet over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. </em>

<li>Add chopped onion, celery and bell pepper. <em>Saute stirring occasionally until softened and lightly golden (7-8 minutes). </em>

<li>Add 4 Tbsp Ketchup and stir fry 30 seconds then transfer to the soup pot to continue cooking with the potatoes.

<li>When potatoes and carrots reach desired softness, add 1 can of beans with their juice, 2 bay leaves, 2-3 Tbsp white vinegar, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 pressed garlic clove, and 3 Tbsp chopped dill. 

<li>Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes and add more salt and vinegar to taste.
</ul>
</li>

<h4> BORSCHT AFTERMATH: </h4>
<h5><ul> How To Remove Beet Stains </ul></h5>
<ul> <ol> <h6>
<li>When you eat borscht often, you learn quickly to pace a napkin in your lap and bibs on children. <br> <em>If you do get beet juice on your clothes, address the stain right away.</em>

<li>Use a paper-towel to blot off any excess juice.
Run cold water over the opposite/under side of the fabric to push the stain out.
<br> <em>If the stain persists, apply a stain removing agent (I have found that dish soap works well in a pinch) and launder clothing as usual.</em>
