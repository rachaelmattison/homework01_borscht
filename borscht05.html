<ol><ol><h3> How To Peel And Cut <em> Beets </em></h3></ol></ol>
<ol><ol> 
<li>Use gloves when handling beets or your fingertips will stain red for a couple of days.
<li>To peel beets, use a simple potato peeler like this one.
<li>You can slice the beets into matchsticks but it is way way easier to grate and children don’t mind the texture of grated beets. <br> <em> <ul>We love our food processor for this task as it grates more coarsely than on a hand grater so the beets still have some texture. It also keeps the counter and your hands clean (beat juice can be a pain to get out of clothing and porous surfaces).</em></ul>
</li>

<ul><ul><ul> <h2> INGREDIENTS: </h2></ul></ul></ul>

<ol><ol><ol>

<ul><ul><h3> How To Remove Beet Stains </h3></ul></ul>
<ol><ol>
	<li>When you eat borscht often, you learn quickly to pace a napkin in your lap and bibs on children. 
		<br> <em>If you do get beet juice on your clothes, address the stain right away.</em>

<li>Use a paper-towel to blot off any excess juice.
Run cold water over the opposite/under side of the fabric to push the stain out.
<br> <em> If the stain persists, apply a stain removing agent (I have found that dish soap works well in a pinch) and launder clothing as usual.</em>
